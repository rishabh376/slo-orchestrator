|---|---|
| Use case | Sre Analysts coordinate correlate traces to deploys for Grafana dashboards, so duplicate alerts collapse into actionable incidents. |
| Pain point | Dashboards show symptoms but do not connect them to owners, deploys, or traces. |
| Success metric | Reduce duplicate observability alerts by 55% across shared services. |
| Cost | $0/mo on Fly.io |

## Why this exists

Dashboards show symptoms but do not connect them to owners, deploys, or traces.. Sre Analysts coordinate correlate traces to deploys for Grafana dashboards, so duplicate alerts collapse into actionable incidents.

> This stack makes logs, metrics, and traces useful together so teams can spot issues before customers do. For this implementation, the service is designed to remove the operational friction behind Sre Analysts coordinate correlate traces to deploys for Grafana dashboards, so duplicate alerts collapse into actionable incidents..

## What this product does

This project ships a production-oriented service that exposes health, readiness, observability, and domain-specific endpoints for Sre Analysts coordinate correlate traces to deploys for Grafana dashboards, so duplicate alerts collapse into actionable incidents.. The implementation is intended to be deployed behind Kubernetes with secure defaults, CI validation, and rollback-ready manifests.
