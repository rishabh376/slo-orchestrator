# Monitoring - slo-orchestrator

- Prometheus scrapes `/metrics` every 15s
- Grafana dashboard: `monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json`
- Alerts include high error rate, crash loops, and latency spikes.

SLO: 99.9% availability, p95 < 250ms
Error budget: 43m/month

Dashboards and alerts are built around signal quality, not noise, with clear paging criteria.
