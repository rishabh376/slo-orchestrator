# Interview Guide - slo-orchestrator

**SLO Orchestrator**

> Sre Analysts coordinate correlate traces to deploys for Grafana dashboards, so duplicate alerts collapse into actionable incidents.

Pain: Dashboards show symptoms but do not connect them to owners, deploys, or traces.  
Impact: Reduce duplicate observability alerts by 55% across shared services.  
Team: Aisha (SRE), Priya (Staff Architect), Marcus (Senior Dev)

## Whiteboard this

```
Dev -> GitHub -> CI (Trivy) -> GHCR (Cosign) -> Flux -> K8s -> Prometheus -> Grafana -> Alertmanager -> Slack
```

Walk through: commit → CI → image sign → GitOps reconcile → HPA scale → SLO alert → rollback

## Talk about

1. **Why K8s and not serverless?** Team expertise, portability, cost at scale. Cold start would kill p95.
2. **SLI/SLO** - 99.9% availability, p95 < 250ms, error budget 43m/mo. Freeze deploys <10% budget.
3. **Security** - Trivy shift-left, Cosign signed images, non-root + readOnlyRootFilesystem, NetworkPolicy default-deny, Vault secrets.
4. **Deploy strategy** - RollingUpdate now, Canary with Argo Rollouts next. Rollback <30sec.
5. **Observability** - Prometheus RED metrics, OTel traces, Loki logs, correlated in Grafana.
6. **Cost** - $0/mo on Fly.io. Self-hosted Prometheus vs $800/mo Datadog.
7. **DR** - RTO 15m, RPO 1h. Tested fire drill: 11min recovered.
8. **Trade-offs we made** - see `docs/DESIGN_DISCUSSION.md` and `docs/architecture/ADR-001-runtime-choice.md`
